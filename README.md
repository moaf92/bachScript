in this project we are going to do remote execution from a machine "scriptbox" to remote machines "web01,web02,web03" using bash scripts we are going to do a web setup and install pacakages in scripts , we are going to add name to ip mapping in the scriptbox "/etc/hosts" so we can refer to all machines with names not ip , we are also going to create ssh key based and copy the pub key to remote machine so we can ssh to all remote machine instead of username and pass 
# Flow of execution step by step 
'remote commands' directory
